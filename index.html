            <p><a href="http://robotics999.weebly.com/scratch-projects.html">Click here to play!</a></p>
            <p>How to play:
WASD for hard, mouse-based movement.
ARROW KEYS for completely free movement.
CLICK to shoot.
Remember to read the story!

The hardest part of developing this game was the sprites. It takes a while to import custom images, especially when you have to remove borders in Scratch. I am currently most proud of this project in this class due to how much work was put into it. It's also fun to play.

            <p>The code in this Snap project creates the Cinemark logo by very quickly creating lots of lines right next to each other.</p>
